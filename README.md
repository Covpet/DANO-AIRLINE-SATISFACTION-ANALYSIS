### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before Deciding the Exploratory Data Analysis or questions to ask, i looked into the dataset to see the areas where they are doing well, areas they are doing fairly well and areas they are not doing so good as a result of High dissatisfaction rate. I desired to check the total count of satisfaction rate which was 129.88K which was doing using the guage visuals and saw that the satisfactory rate exactly dropped by 50%. The count of Neutral/Dissatisfaction was 73.45K while that of dissatisfaction was 56.43K, obviously they had high dissatisfaction than satisfaction. I then went further to inspect those areas that have high satisfaction rate and areas that have high dissatisfaction rate and give my insights and reccommendation on them. The EDA is then Highlighted as follows.

- Count of Satisfaction
- Satisfaction Based on Class
- Satisfaction based on Customers
- Areas having High Satisfaction rate
- Areas having High dissatisfaction rate

### Data ANALYSIS/INSIGHTS

These figures are crucial as they provide a clear picture of the overall passenger sentiment towards Dano Airlines. The fact that the count of dissatisfaction exceeds that of satisfaction indicates a pressing issue that needs to be addressed promptly. It signifies that a substantial portion of Dano Airlines' passengers are not having a satisfactory experience and underscores the urgency of improving customer satisfaction levels. A large gap between satisfaction and dissatisfaction counts is a cause for concern. This discrepancy can have a direct impact on the airline's reputation, customer loyalty, and business success.Understanding the reasons behind this disparity is essential for developing effective strategies to boost passenger satisfaction.

Understanding these disparities in satisfaction across passenger classes is essential for tailoring services and addressing specific needs. This can lead to better class-specific service enhancements and potentially attract more passengers to the higher-class tiers.
